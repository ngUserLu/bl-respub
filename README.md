The files in this repo comprise my public resume website. They are intended to be served through an AWS S3 bucket configured as a static website.

The website may be reached here:

[Online resume](http://blrespub.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)

The actual resume is available for download from the website in two different formats:
- Brian_Loomis_Resume.md (markdown)
- Brian_Loomis_Resume.pdf (PDF)

#### Comments About the Website
Static websites hosted in S3 limit the libraries and languages that may be employed. Generally speaking, the website uses simple html pages with embedded JavaScript to render content. The graphics are SVG.

Experiences are organized geographically. That seemed more fun that just a list format.
