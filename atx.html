                As a member of the ASSET360 Development Team, my core responsibility is programming software in an Agile development environment.
                I work closely with Business Analysts, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners on a daily basis. Under the overall direction of the Chief Engineer,
                we prep, QA, and ship code at regular intervals.
                <br /><br />
                Atonix Digital has a close relationship with the Monitoring & Diagnostics group within the Power Generation Services
                unit of Black & Veatch. The M&D group's business is focused on the transfer and analysis of the operational data of
                power generation and industrial clients in order to make observations and recommendations in the performance and optimization of client assets.
                For four years I have been a primary member of the development team that is responsible for the components of ASSET360 that enable this business.
                Included in this responsibility is interfacing with Atonix Digital's AWS-located streaming analytics / math engine business partner.
                As a part of this work I designed and implemented a SignalR-based communication capability that introduced real-time statusing into ASSET360.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to operational intelligence requirements, I've been able to architect targeted infrastructures driven by business requirements.
                One example is an AWS SQS-based framework for long-running processing jobs, a key requirement being the offloading of compute load from the
                ASSET360 web server.
                <br /><br />
                I've found that I enjoy designing and implementing data models in the database and business logic tiers. I like defining the relationships between objects
                and the attention to detail required by enforcing business quality constraints at the database level. Near and dear to my heart are maps and the spatially-enabled
                entities they render. I proposed and toured an initial data model of spatial objects and implemented a design incorporating
                feedback from multiple Atonix Digital groups. The implementation now functions as the foundation for all capabilities in ASSET360 with a spatial component.
                <br /><br />
                Something I find especially rewarding is the interaction I have with others at Black & Veatch that are
                external to Atonix Digital. I act as a database and geospatial SME for these groups and appreciate the perspective the exposure brings.
