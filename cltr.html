    Hi there!
    <br /><br />
    My name is Brian Loomis. I am a programmer with an architect bent. I have a decent amount of
    <a onclick="letterOpener('exp');">experience</a>, the more recent half of which includes design and technical lead roles.
    Most of my work history is in web development. Cloud-located environments have grown to be the norm.
    I have a solid educational&nbsp;<a onclick="letterOpener('edu');">background</a>.
    <br /><br />
    I'm currently with Atonix Digital, a software company under the Black & Veatch umbrella. While it's great, I see the benefits of keeping an eye open for new challenges.
    The growth of serverless and distributed compute makes opportunities in that area intriguing. I'm at a point in my career where architect and design roles have at least as
    much appeal as straight programming, so I take note of them, too. I'd like to help with growth and transition into cloud infrastructures.
    <br /><br />
