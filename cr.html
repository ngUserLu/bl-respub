                The Undergraduate Study Abroad program in Golfito, Costa Rica, was in partnership with the Institute of
                Tropical Studies. The summer-semester length program included two KU Faculty-led upper level-courses,
                Tropical Ecology and Rainforest Biodiversity. I planned and executed a research project on the
                distribution of bromeliads. Staying with a local family provided excellent instruction in conversational Spanish.
