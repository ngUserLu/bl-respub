                The Hawaii Geographic Information Coordinating Council is a community organization that promotes
                GIS in Hawaii and provides its members with opportunities for interaction and cooperation.
                I was a member of HIGICC from September 2004 until June 2010 and was elected to consecutive
                two-year terms of service on the Executive Board. Board Members are responsible for organizing
                committees, execution of special projects, and the overall direction of the organization.
                I served on the committee for the 2006 PacGeo state-wide and regional Pacific conference,
                scheduled speakers for the Luncheon Series, and was the coordinator for GIS Day in 2006.
                I also led a committee that analyzed GIS and geospatial teaching in public and private K-12 schools
                and developed a GIS curriculumn offered to teachers to supplement their regular lessons.
