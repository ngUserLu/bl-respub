                Hi-Tech Urban Solutions, Inc. was a small geospatial consulting firm with two main service areas:
                (1) GIS consulting and (2) development of 3D models and derivative products. As a GIS developer
                I worked in both areas and led two large GIS services contracts with the City and County of Honolulu.
                <br /><br />
                The first work I led was a large, multi-year contract with the City and County of Honolulu
                and managed by the City's GIS group within the Department of Planning and Permitting.
                It entailed the overhaul and significant expansion of the City's GIS capabilities relating to
                its Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (Storm Water) with special consideration given
                to the requirements and responsibilities conditional to the City's EPA National Pollutant and
                Discharge Elimination System permit.
                All of the Departments involved in the City's Storm Water program were party to the contract.
                I was resposible for writing the work plans, change orders, invoicing, negotiation, client relations, and technical lead.
                A significant user-needs effort was completed at the beginning of the project to lead all subsequent phases.
                A complete redesign of the Storm Water Geodatabase repository was completed early in the contract
                and served as the foundation for all business processes and derivative products. Following
                the redesign was a large data conversion task that populated the Geodatabase with source
                data from a broad range of historical documents, for example as-built records, civil engineering plans,
                and storm water permits. Storm Water GIS data from the Hawaii State Dept. of Transportation and
                the US Navy's NAVFAC operations center were integrated into the Geodatabase. Once the GIS repository was
                complete a geometric network was built on top of it. (Diagram of workflow!)
                During the data conversion phase I managed a team of technicians.
                The third major phase of the contract was developing a mapping application and NPDES data clearinghouse
                available throughout the City via intranet. The application was completely purpose-built
                with the ESRI .NET Web ADF. It included custom ArcObjects components for geometric network tracing,
                displaying network flow direction, and adding georeferenced TIFF images to the base map.
                The application was highlighted in an ESRI article naming
                the contract client, Ken Schmidt, City and County of Honolulu GIS Manager, a GIS Hero.
                The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/winter1011articles/gis-administrator.html" target="_blank">article</a>&nbsp;was
                published in the Winter 2010/2011 edition of ArcNews.
                <br /><br />
                After deployment of the web application a series of data maintenance procedures were developed
                and instituted to maintain the long-term efficacy of the City's Storm Water GIS data and capabilities.
                HITUS's results in the Storm Water contract were recognized with three contract amendments, each carrying additional work tasks and funding.
                <br /><br />
                The second contract I led was concerned with Stream location and ownership. It was also with the
                City and County of Honolulu but managed from a different department, the Department of Facility
                Maintenance. The task with this contract
                was developing a GIS repository of spatially accurate stream locations coupled with a non-spatial
                database of property owners and owner data of parcels containing and abutting stream boundaries.
                I utilized ESRI's dynamic segmentation model to relate owner data to stream runs and produced
                hard-copy map books contaning stream maps and owner tables for use in DFM service vehicles.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to Storm Water GIS, HITUS was heavily involved in the development of a 3D building model
                for the Honolulu urban corridor. Loosely bounded by Honolulu International Airport at one end and
                Diamond Head Crater at the other end, the corridor contains the majority of highly commercialized
                built enviroments on Oahu. The area is also highly impacted by the rapid transit system currently
                in construction. HITUS was contracted by the City and County of Honolulu to develop an urban model.
                The model was utilized in Transit-Oriented Design presentation and analytical manners. HITUS developed
                several deriverative products from the model including hotel and commercial real estate marketing and
                management tools and security services applications.
