                In this position I was a member of the K-State Climate Change and Mitigation in the Great Plains program.
                The program, funded through the National Science Foundation, included objectives to
                study the climatic history of Kansas, develop mitigation practices to reduce the economic impact of
                climate change, and increase the public's understanding of long-term climate trends in Kansas.
                The utilization of web-based GIS was targeted as an ideal presentation and delivery method for public outreach.
                My primary task was to develop web-based interactive maps and tools Citizens could use to increase
                their understand of weather trends. Given my professional experience, I was granted a significant degree of independence
                beyond this main objective in the specific GIS design and capabilities.
                <br /><br />
                I began working for K-State before moving to Manhattan from Honolulu. In order to facilitate communication
                and initiate the Web GIS content design effort I created a website with my&nbsp;<a href="http://services.geog.ksu.edu/ccmwebgis" target="_blank">design and development plan</a>.
                Originally I hosted it on my Amazon S3 site; after arriving on campus I moved it to a K-State server.
                The plan has been updated throughout development and now acts as a documentation of the effort.
                <br /><br />
                A core concept of the application design was a dual-entry approach to accessing the underlying climate data. This design
                accorded equal imporantance to spatial and non-spatial access methods to the historical climate data.
                The spatial entry is the familiar map-centric design, whereby a user initiates access to or interaction with
                climate data by clicking on a map. The non-spatial entry leveraged Dojo's charting libraries to provide
                an alternate entry method. The design goal was to let users select an entry method according to their preference.
                Furthermore, were applicable, each destination weather aspect, for example total rainfall on a given day, was equipped with
                both mapping and charting entrys. The web application is named the&nbsp;<a href="http://services.geog.ksu.edu/counties" target="_blank">Kansas Understander</a>.
                <br /><br />
                I was asked to present the application to a meeting of ~70 K-State Research and Extension agents in January of 2014.
                A&nbsp;<a href="http://services.geog.ksu.edu/KSRE_InDepth_20140107" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;I created for the presentation gives a general overview of the application and its aims.
                <br /><br />
                After completing the primary web-mapping application, development focus shifted to building a mobile app
                for the Android platform. The ESRI Climate App Challenge announced in Spring of 2014 provided some
                impetus for the effort.
                <br /><br />
                Multiple geoprocessing models were created and published in ArcGIS Server for use in the Kansas Understander.
                SQL Server 2012 windowing functions were used to produce rolling averages.
