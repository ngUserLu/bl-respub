                I founded Lobaserv in the Fall of 2006 as a way to test the prospects of an independent GIS firm
                in Hawaii and to gain first-hand knowledge of the business certification process. The Hawaii-Pacific ESRI
                office recommended Lobaserv to an Engineering firm with a project on Kauai who had asked for GIS support.
                I met with the engineers and completed a proposal and cost schedule for services. 
                I developed a Microsoft Virtual Earth application
                called Hiko No! - "Can do" in the Hawaiian language - and presented it at the 2006 HIGICC PacGeo conference.
                Lobaserv was short lived - I accepted a position with Hi-Tech Urban Solutions in December - but the
                experience was invaluable.
