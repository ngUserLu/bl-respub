    Hello-
    <br /><br />
    My name is Brian Loomis.
    I am a Geographic Information Systems professional with around ten years of&nbsp;<a onclick="scSwitch('exp');">experience</a>
    and a solid educational&nbsp;<a onclick="scSwitch('edu');">background</a>.
    A significant portion of my work history is in GIS web development.
    Thank you for reviewing my credentials.
    <br /><br />
    My current employment extends through the end of August 2014.
    I am in the process of pursuing subsequent employment.
    I am interested in a position in private GIS consulting.
    Ideally it would be project-based and include management and technical aspects; over the years I've learned that I work best when able to do both.
    <br /><br />
    I have a mix of management and technical&nbsp;<a onclick="scSwitch('skills');">skills</a>,
    although recently I've leaned more towards the technical side of things.
    I would categorize myself as a project leader with a strong technical foundation.
