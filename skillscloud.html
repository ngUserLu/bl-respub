    Production-level AWS experience is limited to basics such as EC2, S3, and SQS. Development-level experience includes IoT/Greengrass, Lambda, and Dynamo.
    I'm currently pursuing AWS Cloud Practioner certification and have subsequent plans to continue with Architect or Developer certification.
