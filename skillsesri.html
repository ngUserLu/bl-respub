    Some small excursions into other GIS vendor realms notwithstanding,
    my entire work experience has (reinforced at the U. of Redlands) been with ESRI.
    The ESRI product lineup continues to evolve with the rest of the technology landscape.
    I've worked with the desktop package since ArcView 3.2, IMS then ArcGIS Server, and the 3D products.
    I've done some work with Python, especially since Model Builder arrived. The .NET Web ADF
    was a beast at first but eradicated the spaghetti code of the IMS JavaScript libraries
    (of course things have come full circle with the Web ADF's deprecation and promotion of the JavaScript API).
    A couple of forays into the Silverlight and Flex API lands. I gained much understanding of
    Geodatabase design and especially geometric networks working on the CCH Storm Water project.
