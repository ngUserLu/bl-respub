    I've picked up some skills in business admistration and industry-specific areas that are worth noting. From
    poring over numerous as-builts, control prints, and historical sources in the City and County of Honolulu's Storm
    Water project I've learned how to read civil engineering plans and understand utility layout and specification. That project
    also introduced me to the EPA NPDES program and its requirements. I've authored multiple business proposals and project
    work plans, and handled business licensing and certification. Marketing to prospective clients is another skill and
    something I've done since my Woolpert tenure, and something doubly necessary when I started my own firm.
    I'm comfortable communicating specific project goals and requirements to groups of technicians and non-technical audiences
    and adjusting the delivery style and content as warranted.
    Working with end-users is an integral part of many
    GIS projects being able to work productively with them is a skill in itself. Being able to lead and manage a team
    of coworkers is important, too, and something I did during the Conversion phase of the CCH Storm Water project.
