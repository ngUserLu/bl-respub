    I haven't worked with mobile GIS as much as I'd have liked - it just never arose as a contracted work item.
    Since I began working on an Android version of the CCM Kansas Understander I've been exposed to the
    way things are laid out in the mobile world, at least in the Android realm. A big transition has been to the
    java-based design; coming from a VB existence it was significant (but at least I'm familiar with Javascript!).
    I'm not nearly as comfortable with Eclipse as I am with Visual Studio but I'm sure time will help and there
    are some aspects of it that I find useful, like the class outline. The Genymotion emulator was recommended by
    a colleague and I use it for device testing.
