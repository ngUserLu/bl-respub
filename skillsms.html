    I've consistently used Visual Studio as an IDE, although VS Code gets a fair amount of use, too.
    NET Framework and Web API are mainstays but like many others, the transition to .NET Standard and Core is underway.
    Nearly all db experience is in the SQL Server world. My go-to design tool, after a whiteboard, is Visio.
