    One thing I've learned during my developer career, and I consistently rely on it to preserve my sanity,
    is that there are so many valid programming languages that it's pointless to try to become proficient
    in more than a few, let alone expert in any. The other tenet on which I rely is that the ability to
    pick up and work with a language is largely dependent on the level of documentation provided by the language's
    author(s) and/or managing authority. I'm most proficient with the basic web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
    and VB.NET for server-side processing. I introduced myself to, and made heavy use of, DOJO in the CCM Kansas Understander,
    and consistenly rely on SQL for DB interaction. After these, I've leverage many others in limited use or just
    explored them.
