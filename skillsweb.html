    Over the last two or three years I've become more interested in pure web / HTTP development. With the development of
    ESRI's web apis and cloud-based GIS travel across the internet has become even more prevalent in GIS. I learned about
    RESTful web design and Model-View-Controller communication, even Javascript Object Notation in the process
    of rewriting the City and County of Honolulu's Web ADF ArcObjects modules into a Server Object Extension
    and then communicating with it from Javascript and Silverlight API-based versions of the SWAPP. After being somewhat
    hesitant about the cloud in general I've come around to the entire idea after taking advantage of Amazon's
    first-year free subscription. Cross domain sharing is something else as a developer I've become accustomed to.
