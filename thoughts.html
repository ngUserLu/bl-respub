        <li>Project management. Organization. I like to work in Excel. Sets the tone for all project-related work.</li>
        <li>
            Client expectations. Some clients know exactly what they want in a web application from the get-go.
            Others only know that they want one.
            Most of the time reality falls somewhere in between.
            I've developed projects that started with a general idea of expectations and look and feel but
            specifics were refined during development.
            <br />
            The key to successfully navigating project development is <span style="font-weight: bold;">listening</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
            to what clients say and how they say it, with equal importance given to what isn't said.
            Perception in all three areas gives a clear foundation from which to start.

        <li>Firebug. Wonderful. I tried Fiddler for a while but recoiled when (uhg!) I saw all traffic going through the proxy.</li>
        <li>Device-oriented development. Getting ready for my first app. Late to the table.</li>
        <li>JavaScript. I remember ArcIMS and its introduction to spaghetti code. And now the ESRI web development I'm doing is with the JS API.</li>
        <li>Dojo. Really like the DOM manipulation and ui elements.</li>
        <li>ESRI.</li>
        <li>A website is a better communication method than a power-point presentation.</li>
        <li>Managing your own servers. If I were to set up a shop from scratch today I'd use nothing but EC3s (see next item).</li>
        <li>Amazon. I'm thinking about switching careers to AWS.</li>
        <li>Designing for different browsers. What a pain in the a... and have to do it.</li>
        <li>Geoprocessing models. These were really nice to get into - pushing GIS to a browser.</li>
        <li>GISP certification. I've always said that I'd wait until it carried the same weight as other professional certifcation. Or maybe I'm just lazy.</li>
        <li>Knowing when to stop. "There is no such thing as a perfect layout, there is no such thing as a perfect layout, there is no such thing ..."</li>
        <li>The project management career vs. the technical career. If I had to choose I'd go technical.</li>
        <li>The demise of the Web ADF. Raise your hand if you've had to re-write. I wouldn't be surprised to see ESRI bring back server-side rendering (these things seem to be cyclical).</li>
        <li>User interface design. Simple and effective is best.</li>
