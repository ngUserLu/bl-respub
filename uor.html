                The M.S. GIS program at the University of Redlands is nationally-recognized and one of the
                first professional GIS degree programs.
                Its proximity to the ESRI campus in Redlands affords a unique relationship with the industry leader.
                The program includs a regular onsite colloquium series and mentoring with ESRI professionals.

                I was in the fourth class (cohort). For my Major Individual Project (the program's thesis)
                I wanted to do something practical. During my time at the Audubon Research Ranch I became
                aware of the Sonoita-Elgin, Arizona, Emergency Services organization and the unique challenges facing
                a rural volunteer emergency response agency. I met with the Chief of SEESI and with his approval initiated
                a project to apply the capability of GIS in support of the operation. In the course of the project I wrote an ESRI grant
                proposal which was awarded and funded the technology requirements for GIS to be instantiated. It included
                computer hardware and ESRI software and licensing. The thesis was published through ESRI press and the abstract and documentation can be
                found&nbsp;<a href="http://inspire.redlands.edu/gis_gradproj/191/" target="_blank">here</a>.
