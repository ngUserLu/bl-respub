                Woolpert had performed work for the Honolulu Board of Water Supply for a few years by 2004 and decided to open a
                local office to continue the work and develop new business in Hawaii. They hired me to open the new
                office before I'd finished graduate work at the University of Redlands. I worked on new tools and capabilities
                for the IMS GIS asset management system Woolpert had developed for HBWS.
                I marketed Woolpert's service lines to prospective clients and, in conjunction with a second developer
                added to the office in 2005, performed the intial user-needs assessment for a newly-contracted project
                with the Honolulu Fire Department to develop a GIS-based information portal centralizing access to HFD's
                training records, pre-incident plans, and other Departmental information.
                In addition to the project-specific work I generally represented the company's local presence.
